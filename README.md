#  iMercury - A simple P A N D O R A radio client.

This Client was designed and developed by me for me, and as such contains only a subset of the possible features.

I wrote this some time ago and, in the hope of avoiding possible future issues, included all needed dependancies (Namely AFNetworking).

The only requirement is haveing an existing Pandora radio account with at least one active station.
